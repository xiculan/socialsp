SocialSP: The Modular Social Interaction Engine
SocialSP is a lightweight, high-performance social networking foundation built on Laravel 11, Filament PHP, and Tailwind CSS. Unlike rigid social platforms, SocialSP is designed as a "blank canvas" for community building, personal goal tracking, or niche social interactions.

Key Features:
Modular Architecture: Easily adaptable for any niche (hobbyist groups, productivity tracking, or professional networks).

Hybrid Dashboard: A clean, user-centric frontend powered by Laravel Breeze and a robust administrative backend via Filament.

Dynamic Identity: Customizable user profiles with avatar management and goal-oriented registration.

Modern Tech Stack: Built with Vite, Blade, and MySQL for maximum scalability.

Vision:
The goal of SocialSP is to provide developers with a robust starting point to create social ecosystems where interaction is focused on specific, user-defined objectives rather than mindless scrolling.
